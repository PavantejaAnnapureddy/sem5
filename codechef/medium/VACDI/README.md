## Problem

### Vaccine Distribution

A doctor has received a batch of vaccines to treat $N$ infected patients. The strength of each vaccine and the infection level of each patient are represented by two arrays.

You are given an array $V$ of size $N$, where $V_i$ denotes the strength of the $i^{th}$ vaccine, and an array $P$ of size $N$, where $P_i$ denotes the infection level of the $i^{th}$ patient.

Each vaccine can be assigned to  **exactly one**  patient, and each patient must receive  **exactly one**  vaccine.

A patient is cured only if the assigned vaccine has  **strictly greater**  strength than the patient's infection level.

Determine whether it is possible to assign the vaccines so that  **every patient is cured**.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$.
- The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the array $V$.
- The third line contains $N$ space-separated integers representing the array $P$.
### Output Format

Print `Yes` if all patients can be cured; otherwise, print `No`.

### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $1 \le V_i \le 10^4$
- $1 \le P_i \le 10^4$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
123 146 454 542 456
100 328 248 689 200
```

```
No
```

### Explanation:

No assignment of vaccines can cure the patient with infection level $689$, since every available vaccine has strength less than or equal to $689$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
4
300 200 250 320
120 230 180 270
```

```
Yes
```

### Explanation:

One possible assignment is:

- Vaccine 200 $\rightarrow$ Patient 180
- Vaccine 250 $\rightarrow$ Patient 230
- Vaccine 300 $\rightarrow$ Patient 270
- Vaccine 320 $\rightarrow$ Patient 120

Each assigned vaccine has strictly greater strength than the corresponding patient's infection level.

```c_cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int N;
    cin >> N;
    
    vector<int> V(N), P(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> V[i];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> P[i];
    
    sort(V.begin(), V.end());
    sort(P.begin(), P.end());
    
    int j = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N && j < N; i++) {
        if (V[i] > P[j]) {
            j++; 
        }
    }
    
    cout << (j == N ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
