## Problem

The  **power**  of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string `s`, return  *the  **power**  of*  `s`.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= s.length <= 500
- s consists of only lowercase English letters.

        count = 1  
        max_count = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                count += 1
            else: 
                max_count = max(max_count, count)
                count = 1  
        max_count = max(max_count, count)
        return max_count
```
