# Alternating Groups I

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers `colors`. The color of tile `i` is represented by `colors[i]`:

- colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
- colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.

Every 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with  **alternating**  colors (the middle tile has a different color from its  **left**  and  **right**  tiles) is called an  **alternating**  group.

Return the number of  **alternating**  groups.

 **Note**  that since `colors` represents a  **circle**, the  **first**  and the  **last**  tiles are considered to be next to each other.

 

 **Example 1:** 

 **Input:**  colors = [1,1,1]

 **Output:**  0

 **Explanation:** 

 **Example 2:** 

 **Input:**  colors = [0,1,0,0,1]

 **Output:**  3

 **Explanation:** 

Alternating groups:

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 3 <= colors.length <= 100
- 0 <= colors[i] <= 1

        n = len(colors)
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            left = colors[(i - 1) % n]
            middle = colors[i]
            right = colors[(i + 1) % n]
            
            if middle != left and middle != right:
                count += 1
        
        return count
```
