# Largest Rectangle in Histogram

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Hard-red)

## Problem

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return  *the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram*.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 1 <= heights.length <= 105
- 0 <= heights[i] <= 104

        heights = heights + [0]
        stack = [] 
        max_area = 0
        
        for i, h in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > h:
                height = heights[stack.pop()]
                width = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1
                max_area = max(max_area, height * width)
            stack.append(i)
        
        return max_area
```
