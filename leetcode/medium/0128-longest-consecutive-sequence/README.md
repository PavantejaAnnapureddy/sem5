# Longest Consecutive Sequence

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return  *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.* 

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- 0 <= nums.length <= 105
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109

**Runtime:** 59 ms (beats 23.87%)

```py
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
            
        nums.sort()
        longest = 1
        current_streak = 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:
                    current_streak += 1
                else:
                    longest = max(longest, current_streak)
                    current_streak = 1
        
        return max(longest, current_streak)
```
